# In this exercise we will create an HTTP server to which we can upload a
# graph and in which we can get the degrees of separation between two nodes
# in the graph.
# 1. Create a route in the server to which the user can upload a graph using
# JSON and using the POST http method. The JSON data should be
# passed as part of the request body, not in the URL.
# 2. Create a route to get the degrees of separation between two nodes in
# the previously uploaded graph.
# localhost:5000/degrees_of_separation/<origin>/<destination>.
# You can use any code we want from the exercises weâ€™ve done in class
# related to graphs.
